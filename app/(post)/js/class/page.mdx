# 1. What is Class?

A class is used to create objects of a specific shape repeatedly.

```js
// @noexec
class Car {
  // constructor
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // method
  honk() {
    console.log(this.name + ' honks!');
  }

  // static method
  static hello() {
    console.log('I am a car.');
  }

  // setter
  set age(value) {
    this.carAge = value;
  }

  // getter
  get age() {
    return this.carAge;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('car');
myCar.honk();
Car.hello // static method is called from class directly
// Uncaught TypeError: myCar.hello is not a function
// myCar.hello()
myCar.age = 32;
console.log(myCar.age, myCar.name) // 32, car
```

## constructor

The `constructor` is a special method used to create objects.

```js
// @noexec
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  // SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

```js
// @noexec
class Car {
  // ok with no constructor
}
```

## Property

Properties are the values that can be defined inside a class when creating an instance. By default, an empty object is assigned inside the `constructor` during instance creation, allowing you to use the keys and values of properties.

```js
// @noexec
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
const myCar = new Car('car') //
```

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  get firstCharacter() {
    return this.name[0];
  }

  set firstCharacter(char) {
    this.name = [char, ...this.name.slice(1)].join('');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('car');
console.log(myCar.firstCharacter); //c
myCar.firstCharacter = 'b';
console.log(myCar.name); // bar
```

## Instance Method

Instance methods are methods declared within a class. These instance methods are actually declared on JavaScript's prototype, so they are referred to as prototype methods.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  hello() {
    console.log('hello. I am ' + this.name);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('car');
myCar.hello(); // hello. I am car

Object.getPrototypeOf(myCar); // { constructor: f, hello: f }
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(myCar) === Car.prototype); // true
console.log(myCar.__proto__ === Car.prototype); // true
```

## Static Method

Static methods are methods that can be called by name rather than on an instance of the class.

```js
class Car {
  static hello() {
    console.log('hello!');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
Car.hello(); // hello!
myCar.hello(); // Uncaught TypeError: myCar.hello is not a function
```

Static methods cannot access `this`, but they have the advantage of being usable in multiple places without needing to create an instance. Therefore, they are often used for utility functions that are needed globally within an application.

`extends` is a concept used to inherit from an existing class and build upon it in a child class. This means the child class extends the functionality of the parent class by inheriting its properties and methods.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  honk() {
    console.log(this.name + ' honks!');
  }
}

class Truck extends Car {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name) // constructor of parent class (car) is called
  }

  load() {
    console.log('loading...');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('car');
myCar.honk(); // car honks!

const myTruck = new Truck('truck');
myTruck.honk(); // truck honks!
myTruck.load(); // loading...
```


# 2. Relationship between Class and Function

```js
// @noexec
let Car = (function () {
  function Car(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // prototype method
  Car.prototype.honk = function () {
    console.log(this.name + ' honks!');
  }

  // static method
  Car.hello = function () {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }

  Object.defineProperty(Car, 'age', {
    // getter
    get: function () {
      return this.carAge;
    },
    // setter
    set: function (value) {
      this.carAge = value;
    },
  });

  return Car;
});
```

The behavior of classes can be closely replicated using constructor functions. Classes act as syntactic sugar that makes JavaScript more accessible to programmers familiar with object-oriented languages. Additionally, it can be confirmed that JavaScript classes operate based on prototypes.


# 3. Conclusion

Since many of Reactâ€™s older codes were created using class components, understanding class components will help you grasp how to implement lifecycle methods, why you inherit from `React.Component` or `React.PureComponent` for creating class components, and the differences between using arrow functions and regular functions for methods.
