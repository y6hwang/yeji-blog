# Routing

- **Next.js 12 and below**: Both `/pages/a/b.tsx` and `/pages/a/b/index.tsx` convert to the same address. In other words, if the filename is `index`, it is ignored.
- **Next.js 13**: `/app/a/b` converts to `/a/b`, and the filename is ignored. Only the folder name is converted to an address.

In other words, in the `app` directory of Next.js 13, the filename has no impact on routing. The filenames within this `app` directory are restricted to reserved keywords.

## layout.js

It is an element that composes the basic layout of the page. If there is a `layout` in the folder, it affects all subfolders and addresses within that folder.

```js
// @react
// app/layout.tsx
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function AppLayout({ children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <head>
        <title>Hello!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
};

// app/blog/layout.tsx
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function BlogLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>;
}

// result
<html lang='en'>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
    <main><section>my post</section></main>
  </body>
</html>
```

âœ… Previously, `_document` was used to collect all CSS-in-JS styles and render them together during server-side rendering. With the removal of `_document`, this approach is no longer possible. Instead, this task is now handled in the root layout.

Here are the points to keep in mind about `layout`:
- `layout` is a reserved keyword within the `app` directory. It must be used as `layout.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` and cannot be used for any purpose other than layout.
- `layout` must render `children` as a prop. Since it is a layout, it should receive and render the components it is supposed to display.
- There must be a component exported as `export default` inside `layout`.
- Asynchronous tasks such as API requests can be performed within `layout`.

## page.js

```js
// @react
export default function BlogPage() {
  return <>my post</>;
};
```

This `page` will expose the above React component based on the previously constructed `layout`. The props received by this `page` are as follows:

- `params`: An optional value that includes dynamic route parameters such as `[...id]`.
- `searchParams`: Represents `URLSearchParams` from the URL, such as `?a=1`. For example, accessing `?a=1&b=2` will result in `searchParams` containing a JavaScript object `{ a: '1', b: '2' }`. This value is not provided in `layout` because `layout` does not re-render during page navigation. Re-rendering the `layout` for search parameter changes within the same page is unnecessary. Therefore, any tasks dependent on search parameters must be performed within the `page` itself.

Here are the points to keep in mind about `page`:
- `page` is a reserved keyword within the `app` directory. It must be used as `page.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` and cannot be used for any purpose other than page.
- There must be a component exported as `export default` inside `page`.

## error.js

`error.js` is a common error component used within the routing area. By using `error.js`, it becomes possible to render different error UIs for specific routes.

```js
// @react
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
export default function Error ({
  error,
  reset,
} : {
  error: Error,
  reset: () => void,
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
    console.log('logging error:', error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <strong>Error:</strong> { error?.message }
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Reset</button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

The `error` page receives two props: `error: Error` containing error information, and `reset: () => void` for initializing the error boundary. Since error boundaries work only on the client side, the `error` component must also be a client component. Additionally, if an error occurs within the same-level `layout`, the error component will not navigate to the `error` page. This is likely because the page is rendered in a structure such as `<Layout><Error>{children}</Error></Layout>`.

If you need to handle errors occurring in the `Layout`, you should either use an `error` component at a higher level or create an `app/global-error.js` page to handle global error processing for the app.

## not-found.js

```js
// @react
// 404 NOT FOUND
export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Not Found</h2>
      <p>404</p>
    </>
  )
};
```

You should create an `app/not-found.js` to handle global 404 error processing for the app. The `NotFound` component must be a server component.

## loading.js

The `loading` component can be used to indicate that a component is loading, based on React's `Suspense`. It provides a way to display a loading state while the component is being fetched or rendered.

```js
// @react
export default funciton Loading() {
  return 'Loading...';
};
```

This component can also be rendered on the client side by using the `use client` directive.


## route.js

With the official release of the `app` directory in Next.js 13.4.0, support for API routes in the `app` directory was added. Just like `/pages/api`, `/app/api` now supports directory-based routing. Similar to the removal of file name-based routing, API routes in `/app/api` no longer use file names for routing. Instead, directories handle the routing addresses, and file names are standardized as `route.js`.

```js
// @react
// /api/hello/route.ts
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {};

export async function HEAD(request: Request) {};

export async function POST(request: Request) {};

export async function PUT(request: Request) {};

export async function DELETE(request: Request) {};

export async function PATCH(request: Request) {};

export async function OPTIONS(request: Request) {};
```

In the `route.ts` file, you can declare reserved method names like `get`, `post`, etc., to handle corresponding HTTP requests. This approach works not only in `/app/api` but also in other locations where `route.ts` is used.

```js
// @react
// /app/internal-api/hello/route.ts
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ name: 'hello }), {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json'
    },
  });
};
```

```
>> curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/internal-api/hello"
{"name":"hello"}
```

With the increased flexibility in routing names, a `route.ts` file and a `page.tsx` file cannot coexist in the same folder. If both files are present, you will receive a warning message indicating this conflict.

```
error - [next app] app
  An issue occurred while preparing your Next.js app
  Conflicting route at /internal-api/hello
```

The parameters that the functions in `route.ts` can receive are as follows:

- **`request`**: This is a `NextRequest` object, which extends the standard `Request` object used in `fetch`. It includes not only API request-related information like cookies and headers but also address objects like `nextUrl`.
- **`context`**: This object contains only `params`, which are dynamic routing parameters. Since Next.js does not provide a specific interface for this object, it can be declared in the desired format based on the needs of your address.

```js
// @react
// app/api/user/[id]/route.ts
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  context: { params: { id: string } },
) {
  const response = await fetch (
    `https://jsonplacholder.typicode.com/users/${context.params.id}`,
  );
  // const result = ...
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json',
    }
  });
};
```
