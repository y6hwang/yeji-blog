## Q46. Find Cities at a Specific Distance

There are cities numbered from 1 to N and M one-way roads, each with a distance of 1. Starting from city X, print all the city numbers that are at an exact shortest distance of K among all the cities that can be reached. (The shortest distance from the starting city X to itself is always 0).

```js
// @ts
const findCity = (N: number, M: number, K: number, X: number, roads: number[][]): number[] => {
  let graph = new Map();

  for (let road of roads) {
    if (graph.has(road[0])) graph.get(road[0]).push(road[1]);
    else graph.set(road[0], [road[1]]);
  }

  const bfs = (start: number): number[] => {
    let visited = new Set();
    let queue = [start];
    let distance = Array(N+1).fill(0);

    while (queue.length) {
      let node = queue.shift();
      visited.add(node);
      if (!graph.has(node)) continue;
      for (let neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
        if (visited.has(neighbor)) continue;
        visited.add(neighbor);
        distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
    return distance;
  }

  let distances = bfs(X);
  let ret = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < distances.length; i++) {
    if (distances[i] == K) ret.push(i);
  }

  return ret;
}

console.log(findCity(4, 4, 2, 1, [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4]])); // [4]
console.log(findCity(4, 3, 2, 1, [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]])); // []
```

## Q47. Efficient Hacking

A hacker is trying to hack a company. This company has N computers, some of which trust others, while some do not. If computer A trusts computer B, then hacking B also allows A to be hacked. Given the trust relationships between the company's computers, write code to find the computer number that can hack the most computers at once.

```js
// @ts
const hack = (N: number, trust: number[][]): number[] => {
  let graph = new Map();

  for (let t of trust) {
    if (graph.has(t[0])) graph.get(t[0]).push(t[1]);
    else graph.set(t[0], [t[1]]);
  }

  let reliability = new Array(N+1).fill(0);
  const bfs = (start: number): void => {
    let visited = new Set();
    let queue = [start];

    while (queue.length) {
      let node = queue.shift();
      visited.add(node);
      if (!graph.has(node)) continue;
      for (let t of graph.get(node)) {
        if (visited.has(t)) continue;
        visited.add(t);
        reliability[t]++;
        queue.push(t);
      }
    }
  }

  for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) bfs(i);

  let ret: number[] = [];
  const max = Math.max(...reliability);
  for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    if (reliability[i] === max) ret.push(i);
  }
  return ret;
}

console.log(hack(5, [[3,1], [3,2], [4,3], [5,3]])); // [1, 2]
```

## Q48. Bipartite Graph

A graph is called a bipartite graph if it can be divided into two sets such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent. Given a graph, write code to determine whether the graph is a bipartite graph.

```js
// @ts
const isBipartite = (N: number, E: number, edges: number[][]): boolean => {
  let graph = new Map();
    
  for (let edge of edges) {
    if (graph.has(edge[0])) graph.get(edge[0]).push(edge[1]);
    else graph.set(edge[0], [edge[1]]);
  }
  
  let visited = new Set();
  let check = new Array(N+1).fill(0);
  let isEven = true;
  const dfs = (node) => {
    visited.add(node);
    if (!graph.has(node)) return;
    for (let neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        check[neighbor] = (check[node]+1)%2;
        dfs(neighbor);
      } else if (check[node] === check[neighbor]) {
        isEven = false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (let node of graph.keys()) {
    dfs(node);
  }
  return isEven
}

console.log(isBipartite(3, 2, [[1,3], [2,3]])); // true
console.log(isBipartite(4, 4, [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,2]])); // false
```

## Q49. Water Containers

You have three water containers with capacities A, B, and C liters (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 200). Initially, the first two containers are empty, and the third container is filled to capacity. You can pour water from one container into another, and you can keep pouring until either one container is empty or the other is full. Assume no water is lost during the process. Write code to determine all possible amounts of water that could remain in the third container when the first container is empty.

```js
// @ts
const MAX_LITRE = 200;

const pourWater = (A: number, B: number, C: number): number[] => {
  const from = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2] // A: 0, B: 1, C: 2
  const to = [1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1]
  let now = [A, B, C];

  let ans = Array(MAX_LITRE + 1).fill(false);
  const bfs = () => {
    let visited = Array(MAX_LITRE + 1).fill().map(() => Array(MAX_LITRE + 1).fill(false));
    let queue = [[0, 0]];

    visited[0][0] = true;
    ans[now[2]] = true;

    while (queue.length) {
      let node = queue.shift();
      let [a, b] = node;
      let c = now[2] - a - b;

      for (let k = 0; k < 6; k++) {
        let next = [a, b, c];
        next[to[k]] += next[from[k]];
        next[from[k]] = 0;
        if (next[to[k]] > now[to[k]]) { // overflow
          next[from[k]] = next[to[k]] - now[to[k]];
          next[to[k]] = now[to[k]];
        }
        if (!visited[next[0]][next[1]]) {
          visited[next[0]][next[1]] = true;
          queue.push([next[0], next[1]]);
          if (next[0] === 0) { // A empty
            ans[next[2]] = true;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  bfs();
  let ret = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) {
    if (ans[i]) ret.push(i);
  }

  return ret;
}

console.log(pourWater(8, 9, 10)); // 1, 2, 8, 9, 10
```


# 1. Union-Find


Union-Find is an algorithm used to manage and group nodes in a set, typically when you want to determine if two specific nodes are connected or belong to the same set. The algorithm consists of two main operations: union and find.

- **Union Operation**: This operation merges the sets that contain two specific nodes into one single set. Essentially, it connects the two nodes and any other nodes in their respective sets, making them part of the same group.
- **Find Operation**: This operation returns the representative node (often called the root or parent) of the set to which a specific node belongs. By finding this representative, you can check if two nodes belong to the same set.

### Algorithm Implementation Explanation

To implement Union-Find, you typically use two techniques: **path compression** and **union by rank/size**.

1. **Path Compression**: This technique is used during the find operation. When you perform a find operation on a node, the algorithm traces up to the root of its set. Path compression then flattens the structure by directly connecting each node visited along the way to the root, making future operations faster.
2. **Union by Rank/Size**: When you perform a union operation, you should connect the smaller tree under the larger tree (if using union by size) or the tree with lesser depth under the tree with greater depth (if using union by rank). This keeps the overall structure balanced, preventing the tree from becoming too deep and making operations more efficient.

A typical implementation of Union-Find involves maintaining two arrays:
- A **parent array**, where each index represents a node, and the value at that index represents its parent node.
- A **rank/size array** that keeps track of the rank (or size) of each tree, used to optimize the union operation.

## Q50. Union Find

```js
// @ts
class UnionFind {
    parent: number[];
    rank: number[];

    constructor(n: number) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(n).fill(1);
    }

    find(a: number): number {
        if (this.parent[a] !== a) {
            this.parent[a] = this.find(this.parent[a]); // Path compression
        }
        return this.parent[a];
    }

    union(a: number, b: number): void {
        const rootA = this.find(a);
        const rootB = this.find(b);

        if (rootA !== rootB) {
            if (this.rank[rootA] > this.rank[rootB]) {
                this.parent[rootB] = rootA;
            } else if (this.rank[rootA] < this.rank[rootB]) {
                this.parent[rootA] = rootB;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootB] = rootA;
                this.rank[rootA] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example usage:
const uf = new UnionFind(7);
uf.union(1, 3);
console.log(uf.find(1) === uf.find(7)); // false
uf.union(7, 6);
console.log(uf.find(7) === uf.find(1)); // false
uf.union(3, 7);
uf.union(4, 2);
uf.union(1, 1);
console.log(uf.find(1) === uf.find(7)); // true
```

## Q51. Planning a Trip

You and your friends are planning a trip. There are N cities at the travel destination, and there may or may not be roads between any two cities. Given a travel plan, you want to determine if it is possible to follow this plan. The trip can involve passing through other cities along the way. Write code to determine if it is possible to travel according to the plan, given the number of cities, the connectivity between the cities, and the sequence of cities included in the travel plan.

```js
// @ts
const planTrip = (N: number, M: number, roads: number[][], plan: number[]): boolean => {
  let parent = Array.from({ length: N+1 }, (_, i) => i);

  const find = (a: number): number => {
    if (parent[a] !== a) {
      parent[a] = find(parent[a]); // path compression
    }
    return parent[a];
  }

  const union = (a: number, b: number): void => {
    const rootA = find(a);
    const rootB = find(b);

    if (rootA !== rootB) parent[b] = rootA;
  }

  let cities = Array(N+1).fill().map(() => Array(N+1).fill(0));
  for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    cities[i] = roads[i-1];
    cities[i].unshift(0);
  }
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
      if (cities[i][j]) union(i,j);
    }
  }

  let route = plan;
  route.unshift(0);

  let index = find(route[1]);
  let isConnect = true;
  for (let i = 2; i < route.length; i++) {
    if (index != find(route[i])) {
      isConnect = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  return isConnect;
}

const roads = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0],
]; // road[i,j] == 1, if city i and city j is connected
console.log(planTrip(3, 3, roads, [1, 2, 3]));
```

## Q52. I Don’t Want to Be a Liar

Pinocchio loves to tell his favorite story every time he goes to a party. The more he exaggerates, the more interesting the story becomes, so he wants to exaggerate as much as possible. However, the problem is that some people know the truth about the story. Pinocchio doesn’t want to be caught exaggerating and be known as a liar. Therefore, if these people are at the party, he has no choice but to tell the truth.

Given the number of people \( N \), the people who know the truth, and the list of people attending each party, write code to find the maximum number of parties where Pinocchio can exaggerate his story without being known as a liar, assuming that he must attend all parties.

```js
// @ts
const maxExaggeratedParties = (N: number, M: number, tPeople: number[], attenders: number[][]): number => {
    let parent = Array.from({ length: N+1}, (_, i) => i);

    const find = (a: number): number => {
    if (parent[a] !== a) {
      parent[a] = find(parent[a]); // path compression
    }
    return parent[a];
  }

  const union = (a: number, b: number): void => {
    const rootA = find(a);
    const rootB = find(b);

    if (rootA !== rootB) parent[b] = rootA;
  }
    
    for (let attender of attenders) {
        let rep = attender[0];
        for (let i = 1; i < attender.length; i++) {
            union(rep, attender[i]);
        }
    }
    let tPeopleRep = new Set();
    tPeople.map((p) => tPeopleRep.add(find(p)));
    
    let ret = 0;
    for (let attender of attenders) {
        if (!tPeopleRep.has(find(attender[0]))) ret++;
    }

    return ret;
}

console.log(maxExaggeratedParties(4, 3, [], [
  [1, 2], [3], [2, 3, 4]
])); // 3

console.log(maxExaggeratedParties(4, 5, [1], [
  [1], [2], [3], [4], [4, 1]
])); // 2

console.log(maxExaggeratedParties(8, 5, [1, 2, 7], [
  [3, 4], [5], [5,6], [6, 8], [8]
])); // 5
```

# 2. Topological Sort

Topological Sort is an algorithm used to order the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in a linear sequence, such that for every directed edge \( u \rightarrow v \), vertex \( u \) appears before vertex \( v \) in the sequence. This ordering is particularly useful in scenarios where there are dependencies between tasks, such as scheduling, task execution order, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Topological Sort only applies to DAGs. A DAG is a graph that has directed edges and no cycles, meaning you cannot start at a vertex and follow a directed path that leads back to the same vertex.

2. **Linear Ordering:** The result of a Topological Sort is a linear ordering of vertices where each vertex comes before any other vertex it has an outgoing edge to. If the graph has multiple valid topological orders, the algorithm may return any of them.

### Algorithms for Topological Sort:

1. **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based):**
   - **Concept:** This algorithm repeatedly removes vertices with no incoming edges (i.e., vertices with in-degree of 0) and places them in the sorted order.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
     2. Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to a queue.
     3. While the queue is not empty, remove a vertex from the queue, add it to the topological order, and decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1. If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
     4. If the number of vertices in the topological order equals the number of vertices in the graph, a valid topological sort exists.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS-based):**
   - **Concept:** This algorithm performs a DFS on the graph and orders the vertices based on their finishing times (when all descendants of a vertex are processed).
   - **Steps:**
     1. Perform a DFS traversal on the graph.
     2. After visiting a vertex and all its neighbors, push the vertex onto a stack.
     3. Once all vertices have been visited, pop vertices from the stack to get the topological order.


## Q53. Topological Sort

Given an integer `N`, number of nodes (1, ..., N), and edges, return sorted nodes.

```js
// @ts
const sort = (N: number, edges: number[][]): number[] => {
  let ret: number[] = [];
  let degree: number[] = new Array(N+1).fill(0);
  for (let edge of edges) degree[edge[1]]++;

  let queue: number[] = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    if (degree[i] === 0) queue.push(i);
  }
  
  while (queue.length) {
    let cur = queue.pop();
    ret.push(cur);
    for (let edge of edges) {
      if (cur === edge[0]) {
        degree[edge[1]]--;
        if (degree[edge[1]] === 0) queue.push(edge[1]);
      }
    }
  }

  return ret;
}

console.log(sort(4, [[4, 2], [3, 1], [3, 4]]))
```

## Q54. Starcraft

Given and two integer arrays `buildings` and `prereq`, times take to build each buildings and prerequisite buildings, return an integer array of time needed to construct each building.

```js
// @ts

const constructTime = (buildings: number[], prereq: number[][]): number[] => {
  let degree = prereq.map(p => p.length);
  let edge = new Array(buildings.length).fill().map(() => new Array());
  for (let i = 0; i < prereq.length; i++) prereq[i].map(p => edge[p].push(i));

  let queue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < degree.length; i++) {
      if (degree[i] === 0) queue.push(i);
    }
    
    
    let ret = new Array(buildings.length).fill(0);
    while (queue.length) {
      let cur = queue.pop();
      for (let next of edge[cur]) {
        degree[next]--;
        ret[next] = Math.max(ret[next] + buildings[cur], ret[cur]+buildings[cur]);
        console.log(cur, next, ret);
        if (degree[next] === 0) queue.push(next);
      }
    }
    
    return ret.map((r, i) => r + buildings[i]);

}

let buildings = [10, 10, 4, 4, 3];
let prereq = [[], [0], [0], [2, 0], [2]];
console.log(constructTime(buildings, prereq));
```
